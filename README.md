## Adding / editing a project

Each project is **one folder** in `src/content/projects/`:

```
src/content/projects/
└── conjure/
    ├── index.md    ← all text + settings
    ├── cover.jpg   ← card + page cover image
    ├── 01.jpg      ← images used inside the page
    └── 02.jpg
```

**To add a project:** copy an existing folder, rename it (the folder name becomes the URL, e.g. `myproject` → `/work/myproject/`), drop your images in, and edit `index.md`:

```md
---
title: 'Conjure'
categories: ['Mobile App', 'Case Study']   # shown as "Mobile App | Case Study"
description: 'One or two sentences. Used on the card and as the page intro.'
year: '2025'
role: 'UX & UI Design'
tools: ['Figma', 'Illustrator']
cover: './cover.jpg'
coverAlt: 'Short image description'
order: 1            # lower number = shown first
# externalUrl: 'https://…'   # optional: adds a "Live" link
# featured: false            # hide from the landing grid
# draft: true                # hide the project completely
---

A short intro sentence or two.

![Describe the image](./01.jpg)

## Optional small heading

Only write text for the really important stuff — the images do the talking.

![Another image](./02.jpg)
```

That's the whole system: **images with a few short sentences in between.** Every image you reference gets optimized automatically (WebP, responsive sizes).

**Cover images:** use a **16:9** ratio — **1600 × 900 px** is ideal (a YouTube-thumbnail export drops straight in). The card preview shows the whole cover with only a tiny (~3%) trim at the edges, so keep important text a little away from the very border. Inside-the-page images (the `![](...)` ones) can be any size — they show at full width, uncropped.

The four demo projects (Conjure, TrialMatch, Epoch, Bionova) are placeholders — replace them with your real work.

---

## Your photos

- `src/assets/image_pill_me.png` — used in the hero pill **and** on the About page. Replace it with any wide image (~1400×450, the pill shape is baked in / cropped by the container).
- `public/og.jpg` — the preview image shown when you share your link (1200×630).

---

## Before you go live — checklist

- [ ] Replace the 4 demo projects with real work
- [ ] Drop your CV at `src/assets/cv.pdf` — **the Download CV button stays hidden until you do**, so no broken link ever reaches a recruiter (the build prints a warning to remind you)
- [ ] Fill in `src/data/experience.ts` (everything in `[brackets]`)
- [ ] Check email + add social links in `src/data/site.ts`
- [ ] Optional: add a phone number to `src/pages/imprint.astro` (e-mail alone satisfies § 5 DDG, so this is not required)
- [ ] Have the Impressum + Datenschutzerklärung checked by a lawyer before going live — especially whether the `c/o Online-Impressum` address counts as a *ladungsfähige Anschrift* for your setup
- [ ] Put your Duolingo streak in `src/data/sidequests.ts` — **while it is `0` the card stays hidden**, so nothing invented ever goes live
- [ ] Set your real domain in `astro.config.mjs`
- [ ] Optional: swap `public/og.jpg` for a designed share image

## Animations — how they work

All motion lives in `src/scripts/app.js` and is driven by small `data-` attributes you can put on any element:

| Attribute / class | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `data-enter` | fades up as part of the page-load choreography |
| `data-reveal` | fades up when scrolled into view |
| `data-mask` + `.mask > .mi` spans | masked line reveal (text slides out of a clipped box) |
| `data-cover` | big image clip-reveal on page load |
| `data-card` / `data-card-img` | project card reveal + parallax + hover zoom |
| `data-parallax` | gentle vertical parallax |
| `.magnetic` | element sticks slightly to the cursor |
| `.hero-tools` / `.tool-float` | tool icons that float around the hero title (bob + cursor parallax) |

The floating hero icons orbit the title on desktop/tablet and fall back to a
tidy row under the subtext on phones. Reposition or restyle them in
`src/components/Tools.astro` (each icon's `dx`/`dy` = desktop position).

Smooth scrolling and all animations automatically switch off for users with `prefers-reduced-motion`, and the site is fully readable with JavaScript disabled.

The **Smooth / Instant toggle** in the top bar lets any visitor turn the eased (Lenis) scrolling off in favour of native instant scrolling; the choice is remembered in their browser (`localStorage`). Default is smooth, or instant when the OS requests reduced motion.

The **Light / Dark toggle** sits next to it. The theme is applied before the page paints (so there is never a flash of the wrong theme) and is remembered in `localStorage`. Visitors who haven't chosen follow their operating system setting.

Both palettes are plain CSS variables, so the whole site — including Tailwind classes like `text-ink/75` — adapts automatically. When adding new markup, use the semantic tokens instead of fixed colors:

| Token | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| `paper` / `ink` | page background / main text (they swap in dark mode) |
| `soft` | muted secondary text |
| `lime` / `lime-ink` | the accent (big text / small text & icons) |
| `on-lime` | text placed **on** a lime background (stays dark in both modes) |
| `card` | raised surfaces: tool chips, nav pill, toggles |
| `panel` / `panel-fg` | the dark footer block and its text |

---

## Deploying (free)

The site is 100% static. Easiest options:

- **Vercel / Netlify:** import the GitHub repo → framework "Astro" is auto-detected → deploy. Every push deploys automatically.
- **Cloudflare Pages:** same flow; build command `npm run build`, output `dist`.

Then connect your domain in the host's dashboard and update `site` in `astro.config.mjs`.

## Sidequests & the Duolingo streak

The section lives in `src/data/sidequests.ts`; the widget itself is
`src/components/DuoStreak.astro`.

### The streak number

**Live (recommended).** Set `DUOLINGO_USERNAME` to your Duolingo profile
name — on Vercel under **Settings → Environment Variables**, and locally in a
`.env` file (copy `.env.example`; `.env` is gitignored).

The name is read *only while the site builds*. It is deliberately not
prefixed with `PUBLIC_`, so Astro keeps it server-side: **your username never
reaches the browser, the built HTML, or this public repo** — only the streak
number does. The card links to `duolingo.com`, not to `/profile/<name>`, for
the same reason.

Because it resolves at build time there is no CORS problem and visitors pay
nothing for it. The number refreshes whenever the site rebuilds; pushing a
commit does that, and a [Vercel Deploy Hook](https://vercel.com/docs/deploy-hooks)
called once a day from a cron job keeps it current on its own.

**Manual.** Leave `DUOLINGO_USERNAME` unset and put your number in
`duolingo.streak` instead. This is also the fallback whenever Duolingo does
not answer — offline, rate limited, profile private, response shape changed.
Every one of those paths returns `null` and drops back to the manual number,
so a bad response can never break the build.

While the resolved streak is `0` the widget is left out of the page entirely,
so a placeholder number can never ship by accident.

### Duo the mascot

Drop an image at **`src/assets/duo.png`** (`.webp`, `.svg` and `.jpg` also
work) and Duo appears standing on the green button. That is the only step —
nothing to import or configure.

It is resolved with `import.meta.glob`, which returns nothing when the file
is absent, so a missing mascot renders the widget without him rather than
breaking the build.
